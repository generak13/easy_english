# Mood
**happy** - feeling content and cheerful
**sensitive** - emotions are close to the surface and easily triggered
**sad** - feeling a bit down
**PMS** - the mix of familiar feelings that indicate your period is coming

## Why track your mood?
Hormonal changes happening throughout the menstrual cycle have been suggested to cause changes in mood like irritability and anxiety, but a definitive link between mood and the menstrual cycle is still under study and debate (1-3). However, you may notice recurrent changes in your mood during your cycle, and learning when these changes happen can be another piece of information to help understand the rhythm of your cycle.
